# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientâ€™s information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioural, and medical risk factors.

# Proposed-Solution
The proposed project aims to develop a system that accurately predicts the risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) over specific time intervals, enabling proactive healthcare management. The solution involves collecting historical patient data, such as demographics, medical history, lifestyle habits, and key health metrics, while incorporating real-time data sources to enhance predictive accuracy. Data preprocessing ensures quality by eliminating null values and duplicates, with feature engineering applied to identify critical factors influencing CHD risk. A logistic regression algorithm is employed for forecasting, with additional considerations like genetic markers, lifestyle habits, and environmental influences to improve precision. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using techniques such as heat maps, data visualizations, and confusion matrices, with continuous refinement to ensure dependable and accurate predictions.

# System-Approach
The system approach outlines the overall strategy for developing and deploying the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) prediction system. The project was implemented on a computer with sufficient processing power, running a Windows operating system. Coding was facilitated using an IDE or text editor, with optional integration of tools like databases or cloud platforms to enhance functionality. The software development utilized Python as the primary language, supported by essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to handle data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tasks effectively.

# Results
The results of the machine learning model for CHD prediction were assessed by evaluating its accuracy and effectiveness. This evaluation involved the use of visual representations, such as graphs and charts, to compare predicted risk levels with observed outcomes. These insights demonstrate the model's capability to forecast CHD risk accurately and highlight areas for further refinement.

# Conclusion
* In this project, the focus was on a classification task aiming to predict patients' 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD).
* For CHD prediction, libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and Scikit Learn facilitated efficient analysis and various types of data visualization related to CHD susceptibility.
* The shortage of data posed challenges in making accurate predictions. Additionally, the absence of key features like chest pain location and family history, coupled with dataset imbalance, hindered model performance.

# Future-Scope
In the future, there are several opportunities to enhance the CHD prediction system. This involves integrating genetic, lifestyle, and environmental data for improved accuracy. Additionally, optimizing algorithms using advanced machine learning techniques is anticipated. Expanding coverage to diverse populations and regions, while exploring emerging technologies like edge computing, could substantially improve the system's capabilities.
